gnucash-util
============

This is a collection of utilities for automating GnuCash tasks using
the GnuCash python bindings.

This has only been tested(*) on:

  * linux (Ubuntu 10.04.1 "lucid") with
  * GnuCash 2.4.0-1~getdeb1~lucid (obtained from getdeb.net) and
  * python 2.6.5.

Patches and new scripts are welcome. See https://github.com/bstpierre/gnucash-util

(*) Where "tested" is equivalent to small values of "Works for me!".
